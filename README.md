# EAT-THE-BUGS
A PAC-MAN-inspired browser game created using HTML, CSS and pure JavaScript.
The rules for the game are simple: move using the keyboard arrows, if you move to where a bug (the blue icons) is, then you'll "eat" it, and, last but not least, if you move to where a red cross is, then it's game over (each time a bug is eaten a new cross spawns).


The sources of all assets are enumerated in the file assets/AssetsSources.txt.

I've published the game on repl.it so that you can try it out online (it needs to be played with a keyboard and I recommend using the option to open it in a new tab after running the repl).
